> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Testing GitLab page gave me a little bit of experience of how this specific page is used and also a basic understanding how many factors you need to be thinking even when testing such simple things as registration.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?
- I think I managed to do everything  that was assigned but I am not sure if I reported it all correctly.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management, 
 -     No


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- Visual Studio Code


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- Yes I didn't quite understand everything that I was asked to do but I just did best I could or continued and then got back to doing what I first didn't understand so well


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I am still not to return this assignment as I am only writing a part of it here through VSC but I have used Github before on one previous course at Laurea.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- I don't know it depends on situation, this course didn't really go too much in to automated tests and it does not interest me even though I know automating/robotics is a growing trend.


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Technical like understanding how to use different programs and languages and soft skills to be precise.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I think the videos provided through percipio platform could have been made a little bit better. The way they speak on the videos is very disturbing to me, time to time it seems like they already stopped talking about the subject but then suddenly they continue about it. Like they keep a little breathing break before they continue but it's a bit too long break to give the image that they finished the sentence. Otherwise I like that it was provided videos and book so everyone can study their own pace and own way with all the materials given. For me personally the course content was quite difficult after all and the course could have been a bit longer for people to have more time to process all things learnt, breaking the final 40 point quiz to two parts for it to be easier to manage. I will say I am not too interested in the subject after completing course but I am happy I did it and now some phrases and concepts of testing are familiar to me even though I didn't learn as much with one course to be able to work in the field of testing yet.
